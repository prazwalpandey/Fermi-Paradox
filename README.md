## Exploring The Fermi Paradox

Scientists use the Drake Equation to estimate the possible number of civilizations in the galaxy currently producing electromagnetic emissions, such as radio waves. In 2017, the equation was updated to account for new exoplanet discoveries by NASA's Kepler satellite.

N = R\* . fp . ne . fl . fi . fc . L

N = The number of civilizations in our galaxy whose electromagetic emissions are detectable

R\* = The average rate of star formation in the galaxy(new stars per year)

fp = The fraction of stars with planet

ne = For stars with planets, the average number of planets with an environment suitable for life

fl = The fraction of planets that develop life

fi = The fraction of life-bearing planets with intelligent, civilized life

fc = The fraction of civilizations that release detectable signs of their existence into space

L = The length of time in years over which the civilizations release the dectectable signals

Using these factors and probable values, the probability of finding another advanced civilization in Milky way is very much less.

## Milky Way Galaxy

Milky Way is commonly classified as a spiral galaxy. More specifically, it is a barred spiral galaxy, characterized by its central bar-shaped structure composed of stars. Spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, have a flat, rotating disk of stars, gas, and dust, along with a central bulge of older stars. The spiral arms, which emanate from the central bulge or bar, contain many young stars and are regions of active star formation.

Primary Arms:
1-Perseus Arm
2-Scutum-Centaurus Arm
3-Sagittarius Arm
4-Norma Arm

#### Objective:

For a given number of advanced galactic civilizations and an average radio bubble size, estimate the probability of any civilization detecting the radio transmissions of any other civilization. For Perspective, posting the Earth's current radio bubble on a 2D graphical representaion of the Milky Way.

#### Strategy:

1- Estimating the advanced civilizations using the Drake equation.
2- Choose a size range for their radio bubbles.
3- Generate a formula for estimating the probability of one civilization detecting another.
4- Build a graphical model of the galaxy and post Earth's radio emissions bubble.
