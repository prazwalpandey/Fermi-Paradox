## Exploring The Fermi Paradox

Scientists use the Drake Equation to estimate the possible number of civilizations in the galaxy currently producing electromagnetic emissions, such as radio waves. In 2017, the equation was updated to account for new exoplanet discoveries by NASA's Kepler satellite.

## Milky Way Galaxy

Milky Way is commonly classified as a spiral galaxy. More specifically, it is a barred spiral galaxy, characterized by its central bar-shaped structure composed of stars. Spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, have a flat, rotating disk of stars, gas, and dust, along with a central bulge of older stars. The spiral arms, which emanate from the central bulge or bar, contain many young stars and are regions of active star formation.

Primary Arms:
1-Perseus Arm
2-Scutum-Centaurus Arm
3-Sagittarius Arm
4-Norma Arm

#### Objective:

For a given number of advanced galactic civilizations and an average radio bubble size, estimate the probability of any civilization detecting the radio transmissions of any other civilization. For Perspective, posting the Earth's current radio bubble on a 2D graphical representaion of the Milky Way.

#### Strategy:

1- Estimating the advanced civilizations using the Drake equation.
2- Choose a size range for their radio bubbles.
3- Generate a formula for estimating the probability of one civilization detecting another.
4- Build a graphical model of the galaxy and post Earth's radio emissions bubble.

##### 1 Drake Equation

N = R\* . fp . ne . fl . fi . fc . L

N = The number of civilizations in our galaxy whose electromagetic emissions are detectable

R\* = The average rate of star formation in the galaxy(new stars per year)

fp = The fraction of stars with planet

ne = For stars with planets, the average number of planets with an environment suitable for life

fl = The fraction of planets that develop life

fi = The fraction of life-bearing planets with intelligent, civilized life

fc = The fraction of civilizations that release detectable signs of their existence into space

L = The length of time in years over which the civilizations release the dectectable signals

Using these factors and probable values, the probability of finding another advanced civilization in Milky way is very much less.

##### 2 Bubble Dimensions

In the study of radio signals emitted from Earth, it's found that these signals form a spherical zone extending about 225 light-years into space, potentially detectable by advanced civilizations. However, the detectability of these signals diminishes significantly with distance due to the inverse square law, making them indistinguishable from background noise beyond approximately 16 light-years. Despite advanced detection technologies like those used in the Breakthrough Listen program, our ability to detect our own radio emissions is limited to this closer range. The project aims to investigate why signals from other civilizations have not been detected, assuming these civilizations may intentionally avoid broadcasting signals to remain unnoticed. It plans to explore a range of incidental bubble sizes, from slightly smaller to potentially larger than our own detectable range (30 to 250 light-years), although the upper limit exceeds current detection capabilities. This exploration seeks to uncover insights into the likelihood of detecting extraterrestrial signals under these assumptions and technological constraints.
